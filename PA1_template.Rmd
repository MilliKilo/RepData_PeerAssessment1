Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
# setwd("~/GitHub/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity")
setwd("C:/Users/Rubina/Desktop/R/Class/RR/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header= TRUE)
```
### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
##### 1. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth = 1000, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(total.steps, na.rm = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x = list(steps = data$steps), by = list(interval = data$interval), 
    FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(data = averages, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + geom_line() + xlab("5-minute interval") + 
    ylab("average number of steps taken")

averages[which.max(averages$steps), ]
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
# How many missing
table(missing)

# Replace each missing value with the mean value of its 5-minute interval
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps)) 
        filled <- c(steps) else filled <- (averages[averages$interval == interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)

total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN = sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth = 1000, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")

mean(total.steps)
median(total.steps)

weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")) 
        return("weekday") else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) 
        return("weekend") else stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN = weekday.or.weekend)

averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data = filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) + 
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```

##### 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

### Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends

##### Using the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
